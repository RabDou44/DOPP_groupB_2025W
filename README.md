## DOPP group B project

### Problem questions:
- How do rail travel times compare to air travel times between cities in Europe? 
- Are there routes on which high-speed rail leads to shorter journey times than air travel? 
- Which percentage of routes are faster travelled by train than by flight?
- How can estimates of travel time to and from airports be included? 
- Which is the most well-connected city in Europe in terms of minimising travel times to other cities?
- Which is the worst connected city in Europe in terms of minimising travel times to other cities?
